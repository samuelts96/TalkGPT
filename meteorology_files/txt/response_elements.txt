pressure – the sea level atmospheric or barometric pressure in millibars (or hectopascals)

snow – the amount of snow that fell or is predicted to fall

snowdepth – the depth of snow on the ground

source –  the type of weather data used for this weather object. – Values include historical observation (“obs”), forecast (“fcst”), historical forecast (“histfcst”) or statistical forecast (“stats”). If multiple types are used in the same day, “comb” is used. Today a combination of historical observations and forecast data.

stations (historical only) – the weather stations used when collecting an historical observation record

sunrise (day only) – The formatted time of the sunrise (For example “2022-05-23T05:50:40”). See How to include sunrise, sunset, moon phase, moonrise and moonset data into your API requests

sunriseEpoch – sunrise time specified as number of seconds since 1st January 1970 in UTC time

sunset – The formatted time of the sunset (For example “2022-05-23T20:22:29”). See How to include sunrise, sunset, moon phase, moonrise and moonset data into your API requests

sunsetEpoch – sunset time specified as number of seconds since 1st January 1970 in UTC time

moonrise (day only, optional) – The formatted time of the moonrise (For example “2022-05-23T02:38:10”). See How to include sunrise, sunset, moon phase, moonrise and moonset data into your API requests

moonriseEpoch (day only, optional) – moonrise time specified as number of seconds since 1st January 1970 in UTC time

moonset (day only, optional) – The formatted time of the moonset (For example “2022-05-23T13:40:07”)

moonsetEpoch (day only, optional) – moonset time specified as number of seconds since 1st January 1970 in UTC time

temp – temperature at the location. Daily values are average values (mean) for the day.

tempmax (day only) – maximum temperature at the location.

tempmin (day only) – minimum temperature at the location.

uvindex – a value between 0 and 10 indicating the level of ultra violet (UV) exposure for that hour or day. 10 represents high level of exposure, and 0 represents no exposure. The UV index is calculated based on amount of short wave solar radiation which in turn is a level the cloudiness, type of cloud, time of day, time of year and location altitude. Daily values represent the maximum value of the hourly values.

uvindex2 (optional, 5 day forecast only) – an alternative UV index element that uses the algorithms and models used by the US National Weather Service. In order to maintain backwards compatibility, this UV index element is deployed as a new, optional element ‘uvindex2’ and may be requested using the elements parameter.

visibility – distance at which distant objects are visible

winddir – direction from which the wind is blowing

windgust – instantaneous wind speed at a location – May be empty if it is not significantly higher than the wind speed. Daily values are the maximum hourly value for the day.

windspeed – the sustained wind speed measured as the average windspeed that occurs during the preceding one to two minutes. Daily values are the maximum hourly value for the day.

windspeedmax (day only, optional) – maximum wind speed over the day.

windspeedmean (day only , optional ) – average (mean) wind speed over the day.

windspeedmin (day only , optional ) – minimum wind speed over the day.

solarradiation – (W/m2) the solar radiation power at the instantaneous moment of the observation (or forecast prediction). See the full solar radiation data documentation and Wind and Solar Energy pages .

solarenergy – (MJ /m2 ) indicates the total energy from the sun that builds up over an hour or day. See the full solar radiation data documentation and Wind and Solar Energy pages .

severerisk (forecast only) – a value between 0 and 100 representing the risk of convective storms (e.g. thunderstorms, hail and tornadoes). Severe risk is a scaled measure that combines a variety of other fields such as the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN), predicted rain and wind. Typically, a severe risk value less than 30 indicates a low risk, between 30 and 70 a moderate risk and above 70 a high risk.

cape (forecast only) – convective available potential energy. This is a numbering indicating amount of energy available to produce thunderstorms. A higher values indicates a more unstable atmosphere capable of creating stronger storms. Values lower than 1000 J/kg indicate generally low instability, between 1000-2500 J/kg medium instability and 2500-4000 J/kg high instability. Values greater than 4000 J/kg indicating an extremely unstable atmosphere.

cin (forecast only) – convective inhibition. A number representing the level of atmospheric tendency to prevent instability and therefore prevent thunderstorms.

degreedays (day only) – optional elements indicating the number of degree days for this date. See the degree days API for more information on degree days. To turn degree days and degree day accumulation on, use the elements parameter. For example, elements=datetime,tempmax,tempmin,degreedays,accdegreedays.
